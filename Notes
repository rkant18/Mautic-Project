Notes:
1- Mysql is on DB server  and import prod DB Dump on it if we have existing DB.
2- Need to add mautic server (VM) IP/hostname in mysql database

#########CREATE USER 'mautic'@'192.168.1.4' IDENTIFIED BY 'test';     #####192.168.1.4 is mautic server IP ##########
#########GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mautic'@'192.168.1.4' WITH GRANT OPTION;
#########FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

In My SQL configuration
1- MySQL configuration file (/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf). From the configuration, it appears that MySQL is configured to listen on all network interfaces (bind-address = 0.0.0.0), which should allow connections from remote hosts.

2- However, it's worth noting that there is a commented-out line for socket parameter:

# socket        = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock


3- Check Firewall Rules: Make sure that there are no firewall rules blocking incoming connections to port 3306.
